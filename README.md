# elevator-algorithm
Program designed to simulate the operation of an elevator, taking into account a series of parameters, which are the following:

1. A list of floors that the user types before the initialization of the simulation.
2. The floor on which the elevator starts to operate, and which the user enters before the initialization of the simulation.


### Execution instructions
1. Clone the project and import it into your favorite IDE or Java code editor.
2. Run the program, and check the console, because the program simulates the elevator operation there.
3. When running the program, digitize the parameters described above (the list of floors, and the floor on which you want the elevator to start working).

NOTE: when digitizing the list of floors, separate each number with a comma, DO NOT include spaces. And each time you type an answer in the console, press the ENTER key.
